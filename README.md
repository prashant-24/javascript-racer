* [jQuery events](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/)


## Next Level

Build a two dimensional maze which you can use the arrow keys to navigate your avatar around. Have some cells which are passable and some which are not. When the page loads create a random starting point for the exit from the maze, when the player gets to that point the game is over.
